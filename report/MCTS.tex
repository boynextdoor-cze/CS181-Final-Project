It is known that the search strategy that AlphaGo uses is the Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). 
The MCTS search algorithm can effectively solve the problem when the state space is too big. 
Although Chinese Chess does not have the search space as big as the Go game, where players can have hundreds of choices to put their chesses at each step, players still have about fourty choices to move their pieces, which indicates a large search space. 
So we think that it may be feasible to use the MCTS search algorithm in the Chinese Chess. 
As MCTS was not fully introduced in the lectures, here the basic idea of MCTS will be introduced and our implementation of MCTS will also be talked about.
